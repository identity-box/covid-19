Supporting society in the times of pandemics.

## Why COVID-19

The first reason for this web portal to exists was to suport people who recover from COVID-19. After recovering from COVID-19, we want users to
have a privacy-preserving way to show a proof that they have fully recovered and are now immune to the virus.

## Why?

We observed that people have difficulties in resuming their social activity after recovering from COVID-19. From one perspective they miss a proof that they fully recovered, so that they are sure they are no longer a threat to other members of the community.
On the other hand, society may benefit from knowing that some members are already immune to the virus and therefore are not a threat. This way they can be admitted to locations where people _at risk_ are to be avoided. This may have a positive impact on reducing the consequences of the lockdown and keeping the society operational in the times of pandemics.
